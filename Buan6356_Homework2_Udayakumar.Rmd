Answers
1)Distance seems to be the best predictor for Fare as it as the highest value in
the correlation table
2)Vacation 
      NO - 73.35%,Yes - 26.65%
  SW
      No - 69.59%, Yes-30.41%
  SLOT
     Controlled - 28.53% Free - 71.47%
  GATE
     Constrained - 19.44% Free - 80.56%
Vacation and SW seems to be the best predictors for FARE as they are the only 2
categorical variables that are statistically significant when we run the linear 
regression model

4)To use the best combination of variables that is to be used while running the 
regression, we have to choose a combination of variables where the AIC is the 
lowest. In this results we get the lowest AIC as 4039.76 when we use the 
combination of VACATION + SW + HI + E_INCOME + S_POP + E_POP + SLOT + GATE + 
DISTANCE + PAX
From the coefficients table we see that all the values of these variables are statistically significant.
Adjusted R square value is 0.7588 which tells us that this dataset accounts for 76% of the variation.
The F statistic is also statistically significant which implies that atleast one variable in this combination is impacting the dependent variable significantly.

5)When we use the exhaustive search model we see that the Adjusted R square is the highest for the 11th combination. Hence when take the 11th combination of variables into account.(i.e) NEW,VACATION,SW,HI,E_INCOME,S_POP,E_POP,SLOT,GATE,DISTANCE,PAX. In comparison to the stepwise search we see that we have NEW variable added when we did exhaustive search.

6)The RMSE value of the model determined by the Exhaustive search is lesser than the model determined by the stepwise regression. So the model determined by the exhaustive search regression is better.

7)$356.19

8)The reduction should be about $50.65 when the SW decided to cover the route.The exact price that we get when we run the model with SW variable set to yes is $292.9361

9)We choose a model with the least AIC. The combination VACATION + SW + HI + E_INCOME + S_POP + E_POP + SLOT + GATE + DISTANCE + PAX has the least AIC. 
From the coefficients table we see that all the variables in this particular combination are statistically significant in terms of impacting the Fare

10)We choose a model with the least AIC. The combination VACATION + SW + HI + E_INCOME + S_POP + E_POP + SLOT + GATE + DISTANCE + PAX has the least AIC. 
From the coefficients table we see that all the variables in this particular combination are statistically significant in terms of impacting the Fare.

AIC gives us which combination of variables is a better fit. The lower the AIC, the better
